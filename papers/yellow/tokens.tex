Token emission is incoroporated without any modification of internal logic. One output can
contain arbitrary number of different token kinds. They are stored in the
register R1 as the dictionary $\{token\_id: amount\}$. This is the only data
which can be stored in R1.  The emission is organized as appending an item to
the dictionary. To avoid collisions, appended $token\_id$ must be equal to the
$id$ of the first input of the generating transaction. The uniqueness of outputs
yields the uniqueness of tokens. The validation script is then
\begin{eqnarray*}
    &\forall\,id\in \left\{ i\, | \exists\, out \in outputs : i\in out.R1.keys
    \right\} \nonumber\\
    &\left(\sum_{in\in inputs} in.R1[id] = \sum_{out\in
    outputs} out.R1[id] \right) \vee \left(id = inputs[0].id\right)\,.
\end{eqnarray*}
Here $\sum$ stands for the safe sum, which ensures non-negativeness of all the
values, and the absence of integer overflow. The controlled emission of the
tokens may be organized by attaching the emission script to the output
containing newly generated $token\_id$.
