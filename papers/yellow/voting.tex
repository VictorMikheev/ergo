Subjects to voting are instructions costs, computation limit, block size limit,
and the block version. Voting for the block version lasts for {\color{red}
HOWMANY} epochs, and requires 90 percent of the miners to vote for the change.
All the other kinds of voting are organized in the following way. The miner who
successfully validated the last block in the epoch initiates the voting over one
of the parameters, stating explicitly decrease or increase (except the case when
the current value is below $min\_setp$). The value of the change is predefined
as $\max(\lceil0.01\times current\_value\rceil, min\_step)$ with $min\_step$
being the hard-coded value.  The voting lasts for one epoch. Every miner
submitting the block during this epoch has two options: accept or reject the
proposal. Miner's vote must be written in the generated block. Change in the
value requires the majority of votes over the epoch. Every block contains the
vote of the miner who generated it. In case the proposal fails, the parameters
remain unchanged.
